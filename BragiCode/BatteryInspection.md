### FRC Drive Battery verification

1. Inspect all batteries prior to build season. If there are any cracks, red tag them and put them aside for proper  hazordous waste disposal. Place aside and contact Mr. Green for proper disposal.
2. Inspect all battery cables for wear, tear damage and tightness. If cables are cut or frayed, replace them. If the terminals are loos, tighten them properly.
3. Load testing. Charge batteries and place them on a load tester. Connect the clips to the battery terminals. You may have to peel away tape or shrink tubing. SAFETY NOTICE: Keep hands away from metal top surfaces of battery tester is it get VERY HOT! Check the starting battery voltage- it should read >12.5V on a fully charged battery. If not, red tag it. Once alligator clips are firmly attached to battery terminals, press and hold the load test button for ten seconds. If the battery voltage reads < 9V, then the battery is  "Bad" and must be red tagged and put aside for proper disposal. If the battery reads from 9-11V, the battery is "Weak" and can be used for testing. Mark the "Weak" battery with yellow tape on the top of it and store it in electrical or the pits. If the battery is >11V then the battery is "Good" and can be used for driving in competition. Mark the "Good" battery with green electircal tape. Put "Good" batteries away for competetion use only.
